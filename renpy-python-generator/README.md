# Ren'py => Python Generator

(c)2023 Joshua D McLean

Software for converting pure Python files to Ren'py, allowing the use of Python
tools (and one less level of indentation) when working on Python scripts for
Ren'py games.

Additionally, automatically checks dependencies among pure Python files to set
the correct initialization order when running a Ren'py game using the scripts.
